# HeartDiseaseRiskPrediction

The framingham Coronary Heart Disease dataset chosen is publicly available in Kaggle platform. The dataset contains 4240 records and 15 attributes like age, total cholestrol, blood pressure etc. These features are the potential demographic and medical risk factors in humans. The target variable to classify is TenYearCHD. Given a person's other vital parameters, the system should classify whether the patient is in the risk of getting coronary heart disease in the next 10 years. Generally, heart disease accounts for about 12 million deaths per year on averagge. The disease can be of many forms like problems in the coronary arteries which blocks the blood flow to the heart (heart attack), problems in the heart valves, weakening of heart muscles etc. Out of all this, coronary heart disease is more fatal. This disease which can be prevented easily by a few lifestyle changes is however very difficult to identify the patients with more risk because of the multiple combinations of the potential factor. The successful applications of Artificial Intelligence on medical diagnosis fields like cancer serves as the main motivation for building machine learning models on this dataset and classify the patients with high risk of getting Coronary Heart Disease.
